# poo.js

A friend told me that there were no more three or four letter word npm module names available. I found poo was available, so I took it. What now Alex?!

```javascript
npm install poo
```
or
```javascript
bower install poo
```

### Usage
##### Require the module
```javascript
var poo = require('poo');
```

##### Functionality
```javascript
poo();
// Will draw you a picture of poo in the console.

poo.thesaurus();
// Returns a random synonym for poo.

poo.palindrome();
// Returns a palindrome for poop.

poo.fact();
// Returns a random fact about poo!
```
